Financial Document Analyzer (Gemini API)

This project is a financial document analyzer that extracts text from PDF files and uses Google Gemini API to generate insights such as investment analysis, risk assessment, and key highlights.

üêû Bugs Found & Fixes
1. TypeError: 'module' object is not callable

Cause: Used @tools(...) from crewai_tools, but tools is a module, not a decorator.

Fix: Removed CrewAI decorators and switched to Gemini API directly.

2. ImportError: cannot import name 'tool' from 'crewai'

Cause: Wrong import; crewai doesn‚Äôt expose tool.

Fix: Removed CrewAI dependency entirely.

3. Pdf is not defined

Cause: Tried to use Pdf without importing any PDF library.

Fix: Replaced with PyPDF2
 to read PDFs.

4. Multiple dependency conflicts (FastAPI + CrewAI + Opentelemetry, etc.)

Cause: Version mismatches across CrewAI ecosystem.

Fix: Removed all conflicting packages, kept only minimal dependencies (PyPDF2, google-generativeai, dotenv).

‚úÖ Final solution: Gemini API + PyPDF2 ‚Üí Lightweight, no conflicts, works reliably.

üöÄ Future Improvements

Add FastAPI endpoint for uploading PDFs

Store results in a database

Support multi-file batch analysis

Would you like me to also add FastAPI routes in the README (API-style usage) so it looks like a proper developer API doc, or keep it focused on script usage only?

how de acticvate .env file

Good question üëç
A .env file isn‚Äôt something you activate ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a plain text file that stores environment variables.

Your code loads it using:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()


This means when you run python main.py, the .env file values (like GEMINI_API_KEY) get injected into your Python environment automatically.

üìå To ‚Äúdeactivate‚Äù or stop using .env

You have a few options:

Remove the .env file
Simply delete it:

rm .env      # Linux/Mac
del .env     # Windows


Comment out load_dotenv()
In main.py (or wherever you load it), remove or comment:

# load_dotenv()


Unset environment variables manually

Linux/Mac:

unset GEMINI_API_KEY


Windows (CMD):

set GEMINI_API_KEY=


Windows (PowerShell):

Remove-Item Env:\GEMINI_API_KEY


‚ö†Ô∏è But usually, you don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúdeactivate‚Äù it.
If you want to switch API keys or stop using Gemini, you can just edit .env and remove/change the variable.

Do you want me to show you how to switch from .env ‚Üí system environment variables (so you don‚Äôt
